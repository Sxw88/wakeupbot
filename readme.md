a bot that encourages users to put away their phones at night when triggered via the /sleepnow command. 
It will send spam messages to users every 10 seconds, making their phones annoying to use when past bedtime.

Wasn't really thinking straight when naming the bot "wakeupbot", 
but in a sense Sleep early = Wake up early, so yeah :|
